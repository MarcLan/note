# Comment

In Python3, comments do not affect the execution of the program, but make the code easier to read and understand.

There are single-line comments and multi-line comments in Python.

Single-line comments in Python start with` #`, for example:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple single quotes` '''` or triple double quotes `"""`, for example:

## Single quotes (''')

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3 
'''
This is a multi-line comment, with three single quotes
This is a multi-line comment, with three single quotes
This is a multi-line comment, with three single quotes
'''
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Double quotes(""")

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3 
"""
This is a multi-line comment, with three double quotes
This is a multi-line comment, with three double quotes
This is a multi-line comment, with three double quotes
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
