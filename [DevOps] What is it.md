# Overview - What we will cover

- Application release process

- Challenges that DevOps tries to solve

- What is DevOps? DevOps principles

- DevOps in Practice:

  DevOps as a separate role, what are the tasks and responsibilities?

- DevOps vs SRE - How it fits in to the whole DevOps process

# Typical Software Release Process

## Initial Launch

- Idea > Requirements > code it > Test it > Build & Package > Deploy it > Operate & Monitor

## Improvements

- Add new features
- Optimize performance
- Fix bugs

# Challenges DevOps tries to solve

## Frictions & Roadblocks

- Slowing down the process
- Too much effort
- Errors slipping through

### Miscommunication & Lack of Collaboration 

- Developer - Code the application - Can't deploy & run the app
- Operation - Deploy & Operate the application - Don't know how the app works

### Conflict of Interest

- Developer - I need to quickly implement new features	
- Operator - I need to maintain system stbility

### Security

- Manual, bureaucratic process

- Checklists & Documentations

### Application Testing

- Testing the app on different levels
  - Test specific features
  - End to End tests
  - Testing on different environments
  - Performance tests
- Can't rely on automated tests fully!

### Manual  Work

- Manually deploying app
- Manually preparing the deployment environment
- Manually configuring Jenkins build jobs
- Manually configuring user access & permissions 

### DevOps  tries to remove the roadblocks

- Idea > implement > Test > Build > Deploy > Observe
- Fully Automated
- Streamlined Processes

### How does DevOps help achieve this

- Combination of
  - Cultural Philosophies
  - Practices
  - Tools

### In the Center of DevOps

- Idea > Requirements > Code it > Test it > Build & package > Deploy it > Operate & Monitor

### Operations

- Linux Basics
- Comfortable using CLI
- Shell Commands
- Linux File System

### Tools

## DevOps Stages

### Version Control

- Maintains different versions of code

### Continuous  Integration

- Compile
- Validate
- Code Review
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- Continuous Build

### Continuous Delivery

- Deploying the build application to test servers
- Performing UAT
- Continuous Testing
