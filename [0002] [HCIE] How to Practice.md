- Check the update time of the manual. The newer the better

### 0.1 The Guide Error

- **Architecture design:** The security part is not tested and can be reviewed as required.

- **Comprehensive practice:** Some products are not supported by the international website. It is recommended to practice on the China website. If only the international website is used, Bangkok + Singapore is recommended.

- **Migration practice:** No error. However, the manual does not describe the experiment of migrating CCE stateful workloads from MySQL to RDS.

- **O&M optimization:** The APM version is 1.0. The new version 2.0 lacks many functions required by the experiment.

- **Game applications** - not in the lab exam, review as appropriate
